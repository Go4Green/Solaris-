The two zipped folders in this repo are the combined effort of Vasileios Panagiotidis, Michalis Kermelis and Andreas Papazidis for the Go4Green hackathon in Athens on 14-15 December 2019.

The dependencies for the Blockhain and IOT bridge are Node.JS - please use this page: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

Thanks
Solaris++ Team @ Go4Green
